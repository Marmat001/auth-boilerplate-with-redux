# Tourify

A fully responsive CRUD application built with the MERN stack (React, MongoDB, Express & Node). The goal when making this project was to add as much functionality as possible, and preferably by using different programming approaches. I wanted this to be one of my largest and most complex projects yet, to really evaluate and experiment with my knowledge.

## About The Build

Building this full-stack application was a great opportunity to augment my expertise in what I had been learning at the time such as:  <br />

- Integrating firebase for authentication handling and saving user information in MongoDB database, combining firebase with MongoDB for an efficient authentication system <br />
- Using a location data platform like Mapbox that powers the maps and location services used in many popular apps <br />
- Working with a component based styling framework like Ant Design <br />
- Utilizing a cloud-based image / video management service like Cloudinary for effortless multiple image uploads <br />
<br />
There is a lot of functionality in this application, it would be hard to mention everything... so here are some of the features provided:
<br /><br />

- Firebase authentication handling <br />
- Complete login with email / password & social login (Google) <br />
- Forgot / reset password functionality, confirmation email on sign up etc... <br />
- Role based access control for users and admin <br />
- Automatic redirection to previous page after typing in login credentials to access private functionality / routes <br />
- Admin dashboard with add / edit or delete tour / country functionality, booking management system and more... <br />
- User dashboard with password update, booking history and invoice / PDF download etc... <br />
- Tours CRUD functionality with advanced features including continents, countries etc... <br />
- Multiple image uploads with client side resize <br />
- Plenty of advanced filtering and searching options <br />
- Page pagination <br />
- Discount coupon code system <br />
- "Add to wishlist" functionality with "Already wishlisted" displayed on the screen if user has wishlisted tour previously without removing it <br />
- Option to see how many times a certain tour has been booked <br />
- Click continent / country name on detail page to see all tours available in that location <br />
- Integrated Mapbox to display map in application with factual start location for each tour <br />
- Checkout with stripe for credit / debit card payments <br />
- Mobile responsive
